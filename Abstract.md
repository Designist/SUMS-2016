# Rotor routing on 2-manifolds

Rotor routing is a deterministic version of the random walk on a graph. We analyze the movement of
particles in different starting configurations and in various 2-manifolds such as R2, as well as Klein
bottles and the real projective plane. We claim that for R2 a random distribution of rotors results in
an always recurrent path, and that the cylinder, Mobius strip, and R2 all produce locally congruent octagonal
patterns in the all up configuration. See visualization here: https://brown.edu/Research/Chan/RotorRouting/
