# Rotor routing on 2-manifolds

Rotor routing is a deterministic version of the random walk on a graph. We analyze the movement of
particles in different starting configurations and in various 2-manifolds such as R2, as well as Klein
bottles and the real projective plane. We claim that for R2 a random distribution of rotors results in
an always recurrent path, and all non-compact 2-manifolds produce a locally congruent octagonal pattern
in the all up configuration. See visualization here: https://brown.edu/Research/Chan/RotorRouting/
