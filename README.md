# SUMS 2016: Rotor Routing on 2-manifolds

To run any of the visualizations in this repository, simply click "Download ZIP" and open the correct '.html' file with a web browser. Note each HTML file has a dependency on 'style.css' and the '.js' file in the same directory.

There are four key folders in this repository:
 - Arrows: an introductory visualization of rotor routing which follows the direction of a particle among a square grid of rotors and adds a new particle whenever the old one exits the bounds of the box.
 - Hitting Frequencies: a black-and-white visualization of which points are touched most often in iterated random walks and iterated rotor walks.
 - Main Visual: includes a variety of visualization options, from various rotor routing configurations to rotor routing on other 2-manifolds like the torus and the real projective plane.
 - Presentation Slides: beamer slides and '.tex' file from the 2016 SUMS talk, "Rotor Routing on 2-manifolds" by Nicholas Tomlin and Taro Shima.
